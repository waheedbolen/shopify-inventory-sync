# Shopify Inventory Sync App - Final Report

## Project Summary

This project involved creating a custom Shopify plugin that synchronizes inventory across all product variations. The app ensures that when any variation of a product is purchased or added to cart, all other variations immediately show as unavailable, making it perfect for exclusive artwork with different size and frame color options.

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Private App**: Developed as a private app for a single store
✅ **Universal Application**: Applies to all products with variations
✅ **Immediate Synchronization**: Provides real-time inventory updates when items are added to cart
✅ **Automatic Detection**: Automatically identifies products with variations
✅ **Shared Inventory**: Ensures all variations share a single inventory count

## Solution Architecture

The solution consists of several key components:

1. **Server-Side Application**: Node.js application that handles inventory synchronization logic
2. **Shopify Webhooks**: Event-driven updates for inventory changes and order creation
3. **Cart Monitor Script**: JavaScript that intercepts "Add to Cart" actions for immediate synchronization
4. **In-Memory Database**: Stores product group mappings for efficient lookups

## Implementation Details

The app uses Shopify's GraphQL Admin API to manage inventory levels and monitor product changes. Key features include:

- **Product Group Management**: Automatically groups product variations for synchronized inventory
- **Real-Time Cart Integration**: Intercepts cart additions to immediately update inventory across variations
- **Webhook Processing**: Handles inventory updates, order creation, and product changes
- **Reservation System**: Temporarily reserves inventory when items are added to cart
- **Restoration Logic**: Returns inventory to pool if checkout is not completed

## Testing Results

The app was thoroughly tested using both automated tests and manual validation:

- **Unit Tests**: Verified core functionality of product grouping and inventory synchronization
- **Edge Case Testing**: Confirmed proper handling of out-of-stock scenarios and race conditions
- **Mock API Testing**: Validated behavior without requiring live API credentials

## Deployment Instructions

Detailed installation and configuration instructions are provided in the included installation guide. The deployment process involves:

1. Creating a private app in Shopify admin
2. Setting up the server application
3. Configuring webhooks
4. Adding the cart monitor script to the store theme

## Limitations and Considerations

- Requires a continuously running server application
- Cart reservations expire after 30 minutes if checkout is not completed
- Only works with products that have variations set up using Shopify's variant system

## Files Included

- `src/`: Complete source code for the application
- `installation_guide.md`: Step-by-step installation instructions
- `user_guide.md`: Usage documentation for store owners
- `design_document.md`: Technical design specifications
- `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Application**: Follow the installation guide to set up the app on your server
2. **Configure Your Store**: Set up the webhooks and add the cart monitor script to your theme
3. **Test with Real Products**: Verify functionality with your actual product variations
4. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check the app's status and logs
